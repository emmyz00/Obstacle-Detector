## How it works

It takes in two different numbers one for a left sensor and one for a right sensor. If either sensor reads anything closer or equal to 1000 milimeters it sends 2 to the opposite side's output. But if both sides read under 1000 milimeters, it will send 2 to the opposite side that is further and it will send 1 to the opposite side of the one that is closer.
